# COMPLEX_NETWORKS
Active learning based systems for error correction
•  Used BERT for intent classification on banking dataset. Formulated rejection samples by thresholding tensor values.
•  Designed classification algorithm which takes pipeline output of BERT and SVM model for rejected samples.
•  Achieved 10% reduction in error prediction of intent.
